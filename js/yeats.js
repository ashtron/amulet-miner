Thereon\nShe cast herself upon the ground\nAnd rent her clothes and made her moan:\n'Why are they faithless when their might\nIs from the holy shades that rove\nThe grey rock and the windy light?\nWhy should the faithfullest heart most love\nThe bitter sweetness of false faces?\nWhy must the lasting love what passes,\nWhy are the gods by men betrayed!'\n\nBut thereon every god stood up\nWith a slow smile and without sound,\nAnd stretching forth his arm and cup\nTo where she moaned upon the ground,\nSuddenly drenched her to the skin;\nAnd she with Goban's wine adrip,\nNo more remembering what had been,\nStared at the gods with laughing lip.\n\nI have kept my faith, though faith was tried,\nTo that rock-born, rock-wandering foot,\nAnd the world's altered since you died,\nAnd I am in no good repute\nWith the loud host before the sea,\nThat think sword strokes were better meant\nThan lover's music--let that be,\nSo that the wandering foot's content.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWO KINGS\n\n\nKing Eochaid came at sundown to a wood\nWestward of Tara. Hurrying to his queen\nHe had out-ridden his war-wasted men\nThat with empounded cattle trod the mire;\nAnd where beech trees had mixed a pale green light\nWith the ground-ivy's blue, he saw a stag\nWhiter than curds, its eyes the tint of the sea.\nBecause it stood upon his path and seemed\nMore hands in height than any stag in the world\nHe sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth\nUpon his trembling horse, then drove the spur;\nBut the stag stooped and ran at him, and passed,\nRending the horse's flank. King Eochaid reeled\nThen drew his sword to hold its levelled point\nAgainst the stag. When horn and steel were met\nThe horn resounded as though it had been silver,\nA sweet, miraculous, terrifying sound.\nHorn locked in sword, they tugged and struggled there\nAs though a stag and unicorn were met\nIn Africa on Mountain of the Moon,\nUntil at last the double horns, drawn backward,\nButted below the single and so pierced\nThe entrails of the horse. Dropping his sword\nKing Eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands\nAnd stared into the sea-green eye, and so\nHither and thither to and fro they trod\nTill all the place was beaten into mire.\nThe strong thigh and the agile thigh were met,\nThe hands that gathered up the might of the world,\nAnd hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed\nAmid the elaborate wilderness of the air.\nThrough bush they plunged and over ivied root,\nAnd where the stone struck fire, while in the leaves\nA squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out;\nBut when at last he forced those sinewy flanks\nAgainst a beech bole, he threw down the beast\nAnd knelt above it with drawn knife. On the instant\nIt vanished like a shadow, and a cry\nSo mournful that it seemed the cry of one\nWho had lost some unimaginable treasure\nWandered between the blue and the green leaf\nAnd climbed into the air, crumbling away,\nTill all had seemed a shadow or a vision\nBut for the trodden mire, the pool of blood,\nThe disembowelled horse.\n\n                  King Eochaid ran,\nToward peopled Tara, nor stood to draw his breath\nUntil he came before the painted wall,\nThe posts of polished yew, circled with bronze,\nOf the great door; but though the hanging lamps\nShowed their faint light through the unshuttered windows,\nNor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise,\nNor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound\nFrom well-side or from plough-land, was there noise;\nAnd there had been no sound of living thing\nBefore him or behind, but that far-off\nOn the horizon edge bellowed the herds.\nKnowing that silence brings no good to kings,\nAnd mocks returning victory, he passed\nBetween the pillars with a beating heart\nAnd saw where in the midst of the great hall\nPale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain\nSat upright with a sword before her feet.\nHer hands on either side had gripped the bench,\nHer eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight.\nSome passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot\nShe started and then knew whose foot it was;\nBut when he thought to take her in his arms\nShe motioned him afar, and rose and spoke:\n'I have sent among the fields or to the woods\nThe fighting men and servants of this house,\nFor I would have your judgment upon one\nWho is self-accused. If she be innocent\nShe would not look in any known man's face\nTill judgment has been given, and if guilty,\nWill never look again on known man's face.'\nAnd at these words he paled, as she had paled,\nKnowing that he should find upon her lips\nThe meaning of that monstrous day.\n\n                                   Then she:\n'You brought me where your brother Ardan sat\nAlways in his one seat, and bid me care him\nThrough that strange illness that had fixed him there,\nAnd should he die to heap his burial mound\nAnd carve his name in Ogham.' Eochaid said,\n'He lives?' 'He lives and is a healthy man.'\n'While I have him and you it matters little\nWhat man you have lost, what evil you have found.'\n'I bid them make his bed under this roof\nAnd carried him his food with my own hands,\nAnd so the weeks passed by. But when I said\nWhat is this trouble? he would answer nothing,\nThough always at my words his trouble grew;\nAnd I but asked the more, till he cried out,\nWeary of many questions: There are things\nThat make the heart akin to the dumb stone.\nThen I replied: Although you hide a secret,\nHopeless and dear, or terrible to think on,\nSpeak it, that I may send through the wide world\nFor medicine. Thereon he cried aloud:\nDay after day you question me, and I,\nBecause there is such a storm amid my thoughts\nI shall be carried in the gust, command,\nForbid, beseech and waste my breath. Then I,\nAlthough the thing that you have hid were evil,\nThe speaking of it could be no great wrong,\nAnd evil must it be, if done 'twere worse\nThan mound and stone that keep all virtue in,\nAnd loosen on us dreams that waste our life,\nShadows and shows that can but turn the brain.\nBut finding him still silent I stooped down\nAnd whispering that none but he should hear,\nSaid: If a woman has put this on you,\nMy men, whether it please her or displease,\nAnd though they have to cross the Loughlan waters\nAnd take her in the middle of armed men,\nShall make her look upon her handiwork,\nThat she may quench the rick she has fired; and though\nShe may have worn silk clothes, or worn a crown,\nShe'll not be proud, knowing within her heart\nThat our sufficient portion of the world\nIs that we give, although it be brief giving,\nHappiness to children and to men.\nThen he, driven by his thought beyond his thought,\nAnd speaking what he would not though he would,\nSighed: You, even you yourself, could work the cure!\nAnd at those words I rose and I went out\nAnd for nine days he had food from other hands,\nAnd for nine days my mind went whirling round\nThe one disastrous zodiac, muttering\nThat the immedicable mound's beyond\nOur questioning, beyond our pity even.\nBut when nine days had gone I stood again\nBefore his chair and bending down my head\nTold him, that when Orion rose, and all\nThe women of his household were asleep,\nTo go--for hope would give his limbs the power--\nTo an old empty woodman's house that's hidden\nClose to a clump of beech trees in the wood\nWestward of Tara, there to await a friend\nThat could, as he had told her, work his cure\nAnd would be no harsh friend.\n\n                       When night had deepened,\nI groped my way through boughs, and over roots,\nTill oak and hazel ceased and beech began,\nAnd found the house, a sputtering torch within,\nAnd stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins\nArdan, and though I called to him and tried\nTo shake him out of sleep, I could not rouse him.\nI waited till the night was on the turn,\nThen fearing that some labourer, on his way\nTo plough or pasture-land, might see me there,\nWent out.\n\n          Among the ivy-covered rocks,\nAs on the blue light of a sword, a man\nWho had unnatural majesty, and eyes\nLike the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods,\nStood on my path. Trembling from head to foot\nI gazed at him like grouse upon a kite;\nBut with a voice that had unnatural music,\nA weary wooing and a long, he said,\nSpeaking of love through other lips and looking\nUnder the eyelids of another, for it was my craft\nThat put a passion in the sleeper there,\nAnd when I had got my will and drawn you here,\nWhere I may speak to you alone, my craft\nSucked up the passion out of him again\nAnd left mere sleep. He'll wake when the sun wakes,\nPush out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes,\nAnd wonder what has ailed him these twelve months.\nI cowered back upon the wall in terror,\nBut that sweet-sounding voice ran on: Woman,\nI was your husband when you rode the air,\nDanced in the whirling foam and in the dust,\nIn days you have not kept in memory,\nBeing betrayed into a cradle, and I come\nThat I may claim you as my wife again.\nI was no longer terrified, his voice\nHad half awakened some old memory,\nYet answered him: I am King Eochaid's wife\nAnd with him have found every happiness\nWomen can find. With a most masterful voice,\nThat made the body seem as it were a string\nUnder a bow, he cried: What happiness\nCan lovers have that know their happiness\nMust end at the dumb stone? But where we build\nOur sudden palaces in the still air\nPleasure itself can bring no weariness,\nNor can time waste the cheek, nor is there foot\nThat has grown weary of the whirling dance,\nNor an unlaughing mouth, but mine that mourns,\nAmong those mouths that sing their sweethearts' praise,\nYour empty bed. How should I love, I answered,\nWere it not that when the dawn has lit my bed\nAnd shown my husband sleeping there, I have sighed,\n'Your strength and nobleness will pass away.'\nOr how should love be worth its pains were it not\nThat when he has fallen asleep within my arms,\nBeing wearied out, I love in man the child?\nWhat can they know of love that do not know\nShe builds her nest upon a narrow ledge\nAbove a windy precipice? Then he:\nSeeing that when you come to the death-bed\nYou must return, whether you would or no,\nThis human life blotted from memory,\nWhy must I live some thirty, forty years,\nAlone with all this useless happiness?\nThereon he seized me in his arms, but I\nThrust him away with both my hands and cried,\nNever will I believe there is any change\nCan blot out of my memory this life\nSweetened by death, but if I could believe\nThat were a double hunger in my lips\nFor what is doubly brief.\n\n                          And now the shape,\nMy hands were pressed to, vanished suddenly.\nI staggered, but a beech tree stayed my fall,\nAnd clinging to it I could hear the cocks\nCrow upon Tara.'\n\n                 King Eochaid bowed his head\nAnd thanked her for her kindness to his brother,\nFor that she promised, and for that refused.\n\nThereon the bellowing of the empounded herds\nRose round the walls, and through the bronze-ringed door\nJostled and shouted those war-wasted men,\nAnd in the midst King Eochaid's brother stood.\nHe'd heard that din on the horizon's edge\nAnd ridden towards it, being ignorant.\n\n\n\n\nTO A WEALTHY MAN WHO PROMISED A SECOND SUBSCRIPTION TO THE DUBLIN\nMUNICIPAL GALLERY IF IT WERE PROVED THE PEOPLE WANTED PICTURES\n\n\nYou gave but will not give again\nUntil enough of Paudeen's pence\nBy Biddy's halfpennies have lain\nTo be 'some sort of evidence,'\nBefore you'll put your guineas down,\nThat things it were a pride to give\nAre what the blind and ignorant town\nImagines best to make it thrive.\nWhat cared Duke Ercole, that bid\nHis mummers to the market place,\nWhat th' onion-sellers thought or did\nSo that his Plautus set the pace\nFor the Italian comedies?\nAnd Guidobaldo, when he made\nThat grammar school of courtesies\nWhere wit and beauty learned their trade\nUpon Urbino's windy hill,\nHad sent no runners to and fro\nThat he might learn the shepherds' will.\nAnd when they drove out Cosimo,\nIndifferent how the rancour ran,\nHe gave the hours they had set free\nTo Michelozzo's latest plan\nFor the San Marco Library,\nWhence turbulent Italy should draw\nDelight in Art whose end is peace,\nIn logic and in natural law\nBy sucking at the dugs of Greece.\n\nYour open hand but shows our loss,\nFor he knew better how to live.\nLet Paudeens play at pitch and toss,\nLook up in the sun's eye and give\nWhat the exultant heart calls good\nThat some new day may breed the best\nBecause you gave, not what they would\nBut the right twigs for an eagle's nest!\n\n\nDecember 1912.\n\n\n\n\nSEPTEMBER 1913\n\n\nWhat need you, being come to sense,\nBut fumble in a greasy till\nAnd add the halfpence to the pence\nAnd prayer to shivering prayer, until\nYou have dried the marrow from the bone;\nFor men were born to pray and save:\nRomantic Ireland's dead and gone,\nIt's with O'Leary in the grave.\n\nYet they were of a different kind\nThe names that stilled your childish play,\nThey have gone about the world like wind,\nBut little time had they to pray\nFor whom the hangman's rope was spun,\nAnd what, God help us, could they save:\nRomantic Ireland's dead and gone,\nIt's with O'Leary in the grave.\n\nWas it for this the wild geese spread\nThe grey wing upon every tide;\nFor this that all that blood was shed,\nFor this Edward Fitzgerald died,\nAnd Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,\nAll that delirium of the brave;\nRomantic Ireland's dead and gone,\nIt's with O'Leary in the grave.\n\nYet could we turn the years again,\nAnd call those exiles as they were,\nIn all their loneliness and pain\nYou'd cry 'some woman's yellow hair\nHas maddened every mother's son':\nThey weighed so lightly what they gave,\nBut let them be, they're dead and gone,\nThey're with O'Leary in the grave.\n\n\n\n\nTO A FRIEND WHOSE WORK HAS COME TO NOTHING\n\n\nNow all the truth is out,\nBe secret and take defeat\nFrom any brazen throat,\nFor how can you compete,\nBeing honour bred, with one\nWho, were it proved he lies,\nWere neither shamed in his own\nNor in his neighbours' eyes?\nBred to a harder thing\nThan Triumph, turn away\nAnd like a laughing string\nWhereon mad fingers play\nAmid a place of stone,\nBe secret and exult,\nBecause of all things known\nThat is most difficult.\n\n\n\n\nPAUDEEN\n\n\nIndignant at the fumbling wits, the obscure spite\nOf our old Paudeen in his shop, I stumbled blind\nAmong the stones and thorn trees, under morning light;\nUntil a curlew cried and in the luminous wind\nA curlew answered; and suddenly thereupon I thought\nThat on the lonely height where all are in God's eye,\nThere cannot be, confusion of our sound forgot,\nA single soul that lacks a sweet crystaline cry.\n\n\n\n\nTO A SHADE\n\n\nIf you have revisited the town, thin Shade,\nWhether to look upon your monument\n(I wonder if the builder has been paid)\nOr happier thoughted when the day is spent\nTo drink of that salt breath out of the sea\nWhen grey gulls flit about instead of men,\nAnd the gaunt houses put on majesty:\nLet these content you and be gone again;\nFor they are at their old tricks yet.\n\n                                      A man\nOf your own passionate serving kind who had brought\nIn his full hands what, had they only known,\nHad given their children's children loftier thought,\nSweeter emotion, working in their veins\nLike gentle blood, has been driven from the place,\nAnd insult heaped upon him for his pains\nAnd for his open-handedness, disgrace;\nAn old foul mouth that slandered you had set\nThe pack upon him.\n\n                   Go, unquiet wanderer,\nAnd gather the Glasnevin coverlet\nAbout your head till the dust stops your ear,\nThe time for you to taste of that salt breath\nAnd listen at the corners has not come;\nYou had enough of sorrow before death--\nAway, away! You are safer in the tomb.\n\n\nSeptember 29th, 1914.\n\n\n\n\nWHEN HELEN LIVED\n\n\nWe have cried in our despair\nThat men desert,\nFor some trivial affair\nOr noisy, insolent sport,\nBeauty that we have won\nFrom bitterest hours;\nYet we, had we walked within\nThose topless towers\nWhere Helen walked with her boy,\nHad given but as the rest\nOf the men and women of Troy,\nA word and a jest.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ATTACK ON 'THE PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD,' 1907\n\n\nOnce, when midnight smote the air,\nEunuchs ran through Hell and met\nFrom thoroughfare to thoroughfare,\nWhile that great Juan galloped by;\nAnd like these to rail and sweat\nStaring upon his sinewy thigh.\n\n\n\n\nTHE THREE BEGGARS\n\n\n'Though to my feathers in the wet,\nI have stood here from break of day,\nI have not found a thing to eat\nFor only rubbish comes my way.\nAm I to live on lebeen-lone?'\nMuttered the old crane of Gort.\n'For all my pains on lebeen-lone.'\n\nKing Guari walked amid his court\nThe palace-yard and river-side\nAnd there to three old beggars said:\n'You that have wandered far and wide\nCan ravel out what's in my head.\nDo men who least desire get most,\nOr get the most who most desire?'\nA beggar said: 'They get the most\nWhom man or devil cannot tire,\nAnd what could make their muscles taut\nUnless desire had made them so.'\nBut Guari laughed with secret thought,\n'If that be true as it seems true,\nOne of you three is a rich man,\nFor he shall have a thousand pounds\nWho is first asleep, if but he can\nSleep before the third noon sounds.'\nAnd thereon merry as a bird,\nWith his old thoughts King Guari went\nFrom river-side and palace-yard\nAnd left them to their argument.\n'And if I win,' one beggar said,\n'Though I am old I shall persuade\nA pretty girl to share my bed';\nThe second: 'I shall learn a trade';\nThe third: 'I'll hurry to the course\nAmong the other gentlemen,\nAnd lay it all upon a horse';\nThe second: 'I have thought again:\nA farmer has more dignity.'\nOne to another sighed and cried:\nThe exorbitant dreams of beggary,\nThat idleness had borne to pride,\nSang through their teeth from noon to noon;\nAnd when the second twilight brought\nThe frenzy of the beggars' moon\nThey closed their blood-shot eyes for naught.\nOne beggar cried: 'You're shamming sleep.'\nAnd thereupon their anger grew\nTill they were whirling in a heap.\n\nThey'd mauled and bitten the night through\nOr sat upon their heels to rail,\nAnd when old Guari came and stood\nBefore the three to end this tale,\nThey were commingling lice and blood.\n'Time's up,' he cried, and all the three\nWith blood-shot eyes upon him stared.\n'Time's up,' he cried, and all the three\nFell down upon the dust and snored.\n\n'Maybe I shall be lucky yet,\nNow they are silent,' said the crane.\n'Though to my feathers in the wet\nI've stood as I were made of stone\nAnd seen the rubbish run about,\nIt's certain there are trout somewhere\nAnd maybe I shall take a trout\nIf but I do not seem to care.'\n\n\n\n\nTHE THREE HERMITS\n\n\nThree old hermits took the air\nBy a cold and desolate sea,\nFirst was muttering a prayer,\nSecond rummaged for a flea;\nOn a windy stone, the third,\nGiddy with his hundredth year,\nSang unnoticed like a bird.\n'Though the Door of Death is near\nAnd what waits behind the door,\nThree times in a single day\nI, though upright on the shore,\nFall asleep when I should pray.'\nSo the first but now the second,\n'We're but given what we have earned\nWhen all thoughts and deeds are reckoned,\nSo it's plain to be discerned\nThat the shades of holy men,\nWho have failed being weak of will,\nPass the Door of Birth again,\nAnd are plagued by crowds, until\nThey've the passion to escape.'\nMoaned the other, 'They are thrown\nInto some most fearful shape.'\nBut the second mocked his moan:\n'They are not changed to anything,\nHaving loved God once, but maybe,\nTo a poet or a king\nOr a witty lovely lady.'\nWhile he'd rummaged rags and hair,\nCaught and cracked his flea, the third,\nGiddy with his hundredth year\nSang unnoticed like a bird.\n\n\n\n\nBEGGAR TO BEGGAR CRIED\n\n\n'Time to put off the world and go somewhere\nAnd find my health again in the sea air,'\nBeggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,\n'And make my soul before my pate is bare.'\n\n'And get a comfortable wife and house\nTo rid me of the devil in my shoes,'\nBeggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,\n'And the worse devil that is between my thighs.'\n\n'And though I'd marry with a comely lass,\nShe need not be too comely--let it pass,'\nBeggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,\n'But there's a devil in a looking-glass.'\n\n'Nor should she be too rich, because the rich\nAre driven by wealth as beggars by the itch,'\nBeggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,\n'And cannot have a humorous happy speech.'\n\n'And there I'll grow respected at my ease,\nAnd hear amid the garden's nightly peace,'\nBeggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,\n'The wind-blown clamor of the barnacle-geese.'\n\n\n\n\nTHE WELL AND THE TREE\n\n\n'The Man that I praise,'\nCries out the empty well,\n'Lives all his days\nWhere a hand on the bell\nCan call the milch-cows\nTo the comfortable door of his house.\nWho but an idiot would praise\nDry stones in a well?'\n\n'The Man that I praise,'\nCries out the leafless tree,\n'Has married and stays\nBy an old hearth, and he\nOn naught has set store\nBut children and dogs on the floor.\nWho but an idiot would praise\nA withered tree?'\n\n\n\n\nRUNNING TO PARADISE\n\n\nAs I came over Windy Gap\nThey threw a halfpenny into my cap,\nFor I am running to Paradise;\nAnd all that I need do is to wish\nAnd somebody puts his hand in the dish\nTo throw me a bit of salted fish:\nAnd there the king is but as the beggar.\n\nMy brother Mourteen is worn out\nWith skelping his big brawling lout,\nAnd I am running to Paradise;\nA poor life do what he can,\nAnd though he keep a dog and a gun,\nA serving maid and a serving man:\nAnd there the king is but as the beggar.\n\nPoor men have grown to be rich men,\nAnd rich men grown to be poor again,\nAnd I am running to Paradise;\nAnd many a darling wit's grown dull\nThat tossed a bare heel when at school,\nNow it has filled an old sock full:\nAnd there the king is but as the beggar.\n\nThe wind is old and still at play\nWhile I must hurry upon my way,\nFor I am running to Paradise;\nYet never have I lit on a friend\nTo take my fancy like the wind\nThat nobody can buy or bind:\nAnd there the king is but as the beggar.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HOUR BEFORE DAWN\n\n\nA one-legged, one-armed, one-eyed man,\nA bundle of rags upon a crutch,\nStumbled on windy Cruachan\nCursing the wind. It was as much\nAs the one sturdy leg could do\nTo keep him upright while he cursed.\nHe had counted, where long years ago\nQueen Maeve's nine Maines had been nursed,\nA pair of lapwings, one old sheep\nAnd not a house to the plain's edge,\nWhen close to his right hand a heap\nOf grey stones and a rocky ledge\nReminded him that he could make,\nIf he but shifted a few stones,\nA shelter till the daylight broke.\nBut while he fumbled with the stones\nThey toppled over; 'Were it not\nI have a lucky wooden shin\nI had been hurt'; and toppling brought\nBefore his eyes, where stones had been,\nA dark deep hole in the rock's face.\nHe gave a gasp and thought to run,\nBeing certain it was no right place\nBut the Hell Mouth at Cruachan\nThat's stuffed with all that's old and bad,\nAnd yet stood still, because inside\nHe had seen a red-haired jolly lad\nIn some outlandish coat beside\nA ladle and a tub of beer,\nPlainly no phantom by his look.\nSo with a laugh at his own fear\nHe crawled into that pleasant nook.\nYoung Red-head stretched himself to yawn\nAnd murmured, 'May God curse the night\nThat's grown uneasy near the dawn\nSo that it seems even I sleep light;\nAnd who are you that wakens me?\nHas one of Maeve's nine brawling sons\nGrown tired of his own company?\nBut let him keep his grave for once\nI have to find the sleep I have lost.'\nAnd then at last being wide awake,\n'I took you for a brawling ghost,\nSay what you please, but from day-break\nI'll sleep another century.'\nThe beggar deaf to all but hope\nWent down upon a hand and knee\nAnd took the wooden ladle up\nAnd would have dipped it in the beer\nBut the other pushed his hand aside,\n'Before you have dipped it in the beer\nThat sacred Goban brewed,' he cried,\n'I'd have assurance that you are able\nTo value beer--I will have no fool\nDipping his nose into my ladle\nBecause he has stumbled on this hole\nIn the bad hour before the dawn.\nIf you but drink that beer and say\nI will sleep until the winter's gone,\nOr maybe, to Midsummer Day\nYou will sleep that length; and at the first\nI waited so for that or this--\nBecause the weather was a-cursed\nOr I had no woman there to kiss,\nAnd slept for half a year or so;\nBut year by year I found that less\nGave me such pleasure I'd forgo\nEven a half hour's nothingness,\nAnd when at one year's end I found\nI had not waked a single minute,\nI chose this burrow under ground.\nI will sleep away all Time within it:\nMy sleep were now nine centuries\nBut for those mornings when I find\nThe lapwing at their foolish cries\nAnd the sheep bleating at the wind\nAs when I also played the fool.'\nThe beggar in a rage began\nUpon his hunkers in the hole,\n'It's plain that you are no right man\nTo mock at everything I love\nAs if it were not worth the doing.\nI'd have a merry life enough\nIf a good Easter wind were blowing,\nAnd though the winter wind is bad\nI should not be too down in the mouth\nFor anything you did or said\nIf but this wind were in the south.'\nBut the other cried, 'You long for spring\nOr that the wind would shift a point\nAnd do not know that you would bring,\nIf time were suppler in the joint,\nNeither the spring nor the south wind\nBut the hour when you shall pass away\nAnd leave no smoking wick behind,\nFor all life longs for the Last Day\nAnd there's no man but cocks his ear\nTo know when Michael's trumpet cries\nThat flesh and bone may disappear,\nAnd souls as if they were but sighs,\nAnd there be nothing but God left;\nBut I alone being blessed keep\nLike some old rabbit to my cleft\nAnd wait Him in a drunken sleep.'\n\nHe dipped his ladle in the tub\nAnd drank and yawned and stretched him out.\nThe other shouted, 'You would rob\nMy life of every pleasant thought\nAnd every comfortable thing\nAnd so take that and that.' Thereon\nHe gave him a great pummelling,\nBut might have pummelled at a stone\nFor all the sleeper knew or cared;\nAnd after heaped the stones again\nAnd cursed and prayed, and prayed and cursed:\n'Oh God if he got loose!' And then\nIn fury and in panic fled\nFrom the Hell Mouth at Cruachan\nAnd gave God thanks that overhead\nThe clouds were brightening with the dawn.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PLAYER QUEEN\n\n(Song from an Unfinished Play)\n\n\nMy mother dandled me and sang,\n'How young it is, how young!'\nAnd made a golden cradle\nThat on a willow swung.\n\n'He went away,' my mother sang,\n'When I was brought to bed,'\nAnd all the while her needle pulled\nThe gold and silver thread.\n\nShe pulled the thread and bit the thread\nAnd made a golden gown,\nAnd wept because she had dreamt that I\nWas born to wear a crown.\n\n'When she was got,' my mother sang,\n'I heard a sea-mew cry,\nAnd saw a flake of the yellow foam\nThat dropped upon my thigh.'\n\nHow therefore could she help but braid\nThe gold into my hair,\nAnd dream that I should carry\nThe golden top of care?\n\n\n\n\nTHE REALISTS\n\n\nHope that you may understand!\nWhat can books of men that wive\nIn a dragon-guarded land,\nPaintings of the dolphin-drawn\nSea-nymphs in their pearly waggons\nDo, but awake a hope to live\nThat had gone\nWith the dragons?\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE WITCH\n\n\nToil, and grow rich,\nWhat's that but to lie\nWith a foul witch\nAnd after, drained dry,\nTo be brought\nTo the chamber where\nLies one long sought\nWith despair.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE PEACOCK\n\n\nWhat's riches to him\nThat has made a great peacock\nWith the pride of his eye?\nThe wind-beaten, stone-grey,\nAnd desolate Three-rock\nWould nourish his whim.\nLive he or die\nAmid wet rocks and heather,\nHis ghost will be gay\nAdding feather to feather\nFor the pride of his eye.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MOUNTAIN TOMB\n\n\nPour wine and dance if Manhood still have pride,\nBring roses if the rose be yet in bloom;\nThe cataract smokes upon the mountain side,\nOur Father Rosicross is in his tomb.\n\nPull down the blinds, bring fiddle and clarionet\nThat there be no foot silent in the room\nNor mouth from kissing, nor from wine unwet;\nOur Father Rosicross is in his tomb.\n\nIn vain, in vain; the cataract still cries\nThe everlasting taper lights the gloom;\nAll wisdom shut into his onyx eyes\nOur Father Rosicross sleeps in his tomb.\n\n\n\n\nTO A CHILD DANCING IN THE WIND\n\n\nI\n\n\nDance there upon the shore;\nWhat need have you to care\nFor wind or water's roar?\nAnd tumble out your hair\nThat the salt drops have wet;\nBeing young you have not known\nThe fool's triumph, nor yet\nLove lost as soon as won,\nNor the best labourer dead\nAnd all the sheaves to bind.\nWhat need have you to dread\nThe monstrous crying of wind?\n\n\nII\n\n\nHas no one said those daring\nKind eyes should be more learn'd?\nOr warned you how despairing\nThe moths are when they are burned,\nI could have warned you, but you are young,\nSo we speak a different tongue.\n\nO you will take whatever's offered\nAnd dream that all the world's a friend,\nSuffer as your mother suffered,\nBe as broken in the end.\nBut I am old and you are young,\nAnd I speak a barbarous tongue.\n\n\n\n\nA MEMORY OF YOUTH\n\n\nThe moments passed as at a play,\nI had the wisdom love brings forth;\nI had my share of mother wit\nAnd yet for all that I could say,\nAnd though I had her praise for it,\nA cloud blown from the cut-throat north\nSuddenly hid love's moon away.\n\nBelieving every word I said\nI praised her body and her mind\nTill pride had made her eyes grow bright,\nAnd pleasure made her cheeks grow red,\nAnd vanity her footfall light,\nYet we, for all that praise, could find\nNothing but darkness overhead.\n\nWe sat as silent as a stone,\nWe knew, though she'd not said a word,\nThat even the best of love must die,\nAnd had been savagely undone\nWere it not that love upon the cry\nOf a most ridiculous little bird\nTore from the clouds his marvellous moon.\n\n\n\n\nFALLEN MAJESTY\n\n\nAlthough crowds gathered once if she but showed her face,\nAnd even old men's eyes grew dim, this hand alone,\nLike some last courtier at a gypsy camping place,\nBabbling of fallen majesty, records what's gone.\n\nThe lineaments, a heart that laughter has made sweet,\nThese, these remain, but I record what's gone. A crowd\nWill gather, and not know it walks the very street\nWhereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud.\n\n\n\n\nFRIENDS\n\n\nNow must I these three praise--\nThree women that have wrought\nWhat joy is in my days;\nOne that no passing thought,\nNor those unpassing cares,\nNo, not in these fifteen\nMany times troubled years,\nCould ever come between\nHeart and delighted heart;\nAnd one because her hand\nHad strength that could unbind\nWhat none can understand,\nWhat none can have and thrive,\nYouth's dreamy load, till she\nSo changed me that I live\nLabouring in ecstasy.\nAnd what of her that took\nAll till my youth was gone\nWith scarce a pitying look?\nHow should I praise that one?\nWhen day begins to break\nI count my good and bad,\nBeing wakeful for her sake,\nRemembering what she had,\nWhat eagle look still shows,\nWhile up from my heart's root\nSo great a sweetness flows\nI shake from head to foot.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COLD HEAVEN\n\n\nSuddenly I saw the cold and rook-delighting Heaven\nThat seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,\nAnd thereupon imagination and heart were driven\nSo wild that every casual thought of that and this\nVanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season\nWith the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;\nAnd I took all the blame out of all sense and reason,\nUntil I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,\nRiddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to quicken,\nConfusion of the death-bed over, is it sent\nOut naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken\nBy the injustice of the skies for punishment?\n\n\n\n\nTHAT THE NIGHT COME\n\n\nShe lived in storm and strife,\nHer soul had such desire\nFor what proud death may bring\nThat it could not endure\nThe common good of life,\nBut lived as 'twere a king\nThat packed his marriage day\nWith banneret and pennon,\nTrumpet and kettledrum,\nAnd the outrageous cannon,\nTo bundle time away\nThat the night come.\n\n\n\n\nAN APPOINTMENT\n\n\nBeing out of heart with government\nI took a broken root to fling\nWhere the proud, wayward squirrel went,\nTaking delight that he could spring;\nAnd he, with that low whinnying sound\nThat is like laughter, sprang again\nAnd so to the other tree at a bound.\nNor the tame will, nor timid brain,\nBred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb\nAnd threw him up to laugh on the bough;\nNo government appointed him.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE MAGI\n\n\nNow as at all times I can see in the mind's eye,\nIn their stiff, painted clothes, the pale unsatisfied ones\nAppear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky\nWith all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones,\nAnd all their helms of silver hovering side by side,\nAnd all their eyes still fixed, hoping to find once more,\nBeing by Calvary's turbulence unsatisfied,\nThe uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE DOLLS\n\n\nA doll in the doll-maker's house\nLooks at the cradle and balls:\n'That is an insult to us.'\nBut the oldest of all the dolls\nWho had seen, being kept for show,\nGenerations of his sort,\nOut-screams the whole shelf: 'Although\nThere's not a man can report\nEvil of this place,\nThe man and the woman bring\nHither to our disgrace,\nA noisy and filthy thing.'\nHearing him groan and stretch\nThe doll-maker's wife is aware\nHer husband has heard the wretch,\nAnd crouched by the arm of his chair,\nShe murmurs into his ear,\nHead upon shoulder leant:\n'My dear, my dear, oh dear,\nIt was an accident.'\n\n\n\n\nA COAT\n\n\nI made my song a coat\nCovered with embroideries\nOut of old mythologies\nFrom heel to throat;\nBut the fools caught it,\nWore it in the world's eye\nAs though they'd wrought it.\nSong, let them take it\nFor there's more enterprise\nIn walking naked.\n\n\n\n\n     *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nWhile I, from that reed-throated whisperer\nWho comes at need, although not now as once\nA clear articulation in the air\nBut inwardly, surmise companions\nBeyond the fling of the dull ass's hoof,\n--Ben Jonson's phrase--and find when June is come\nAt Kyle-na-no under that ancient roof\nA sterner conscience and a friendlier home,\nI can forgive even that wrong of wrongs,\nThose undreamt accidents that have made me\n--Seeing that Fame has perished this long while\nBeing but a part of ancient ceremony--\nNotorious, till all my priceless things\nAre but a post the passing dogs defile.\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE GREEN HELMET AND OTHER POEMS\n\n\n\n\nHIS DREAM\n\n\nI swayed upon the gaudy stern\nThe butt end of a steering oar,\nAnd everywhere that I could turn\nMen ran upon the shore.\n\nAnd though I would have hushed the crowd\nThere was no mother's son but said,\n'What is the figure in a shroud\nUpon a gaudy bed?'\n\nAnd fishes bubbling to the brim\nCried out upon that thing beneath,\n--It had such dignity of limb--\nBy the sweet name of Death.\n\nThough I'd my finger on my lip,\nWhat could I but take up the song?\nAnd fish and crowd and gaudy ship\nCried out the whole night long,\n\nCrying amid the glittering sea,\nNaming it with ecstatic breath,\nBecause it had such dignity\nBy the sweet name of Death.\n\n\n\n\nA WOMAN HOMER SUNG\n\n\nIf any man drew near\nWhen I was young,\nI thought, 'He holds her dear,'\nAnd shook with hate and fear.\nBut oh, 'twas bitter wrong\nIf he could pass her by\nWith an indifferent eye.\n\nWhereon I wrote and wrought,\nAnd now, being grey,\nI dream that I have brought\nTo such a pitch my thought\nThat coming time can say,\n'He shadowed in a glass\nWhat thing her body was.'\n\nFor she had fiery blood\nWhen I was young,\nAnd trod so sweetly proud\nAs 'twere upon a cloud,\nA woman Homer sung,\nThat life and letters seem\nBut an heroic dream.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CONSOLATION\n\n\nI had this thought awhile ago,\n'My darling cannot understand\nWhat I have done, or what would do\nIn this blind bitter land.'\n\nAnd I grew weary of the sun\nUntil my thoughts cleared up again,\nRemembering that the best I have done\nWas done to make it plain;\n\nThat every year I have cried, 'At length\nMy darling understands it all,\nBecause I have come into my strength,\nAnd words obey my call.'\n\nThat had she done so who can say\nWhat would have shaken from the sieve?\nI might have thrown poor words away\nAnd been content to live.\n\n\n\n\nNO SECOND TROY\n\n\nWhy should I blame her that she filled my days\nWith misery, or that she would of late\nHave taught to ignorant men most violent ways,\nOr hurled the little streets upon the great,\nHad they but courage equal to desire?\nWhat could have made her peaceful with a mind\nThat nobleness made simple as a fire,\nWith beauty like a tightened bow, a kind\nThat is not natural in an age like this,\nBeing high and solitary and most stern?\nWhy, what could she have done being what she is?\nWas there another Troy for her to burn?\n\n\n\n\nRECONCILIATION\n\n\nSome may have blamed you that you took away\nThe verses that could move them on the day\nWhen, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind\nWith lightning you went from me, and I could find\nNothing to make a song about but kings,\nHelmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things\nThat were like memories of you--but now\nWe'll out, for the world lives as long ago;\nAnd while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,\nHurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.\nBut, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,\nMy barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.\n\n\n\n\nKING AND NO KING\n\n\n'Would it were anything but merely voice!'\nThe No King cried who after that was King,\nBecause he had not heard of anything\nThat balanced with a word is more than noise;\nYet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail\nSomewhere or somehow that I have forgot,\nThough he'd but cannon--Whereas we that had thought\nTo have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale\nHave been defeated by that pledge you gave\nIn momentary anger long ago;\nAnd I that have not your faith, how shall I know\nThat in the blinding light beyond the grave\nWe'll find so good a thing as that we have lost?\nThe hourly kindness, the day's common speech,\nThe habitual content of each with each\nWhen neither soul nor body has been crossed.\n\n\n\n\nPEACE\n\n\nAh, that Time could touch a form\nThat could show what Homer's age\nBred to be a hero's wage.\n'Were not all her life but storm,\nWould not painters paint a form\nOf such noble lines,' I said,\n'Such a delicate high head,\nAll that sternness amid charm,\nAll that sweetness amid strength?'\nAh, but peace that comes at length,\nCame when Time had touched her form.\n\n\n\n\nAGAINST UNWORTHY PRAISE\n\n\nO heart, be at peace, because\nNor knave nor dolt can break\nWhat's not for their applause,\nBeing for a woman's sake.\nEnough if the work has seemed,\nSo did she your strength renew,\nA dream that a lion had dreamed\nTill the wilderness cried aloud,\nA secret between you two,\nBetween the proud and the proud.\n\nWhat, still you would have their praise!\nBut here's a haughtier text,\nThe labyrinth of her days\nThat her own strangeness perplexed;\nAnd how what her dreaming gave\nEarned slander, ingratitude,\nFrom self-same dolt and knave;\nAye, and worse wrong than these,\nYet she, singing upon her road,\nHalf lion, half child, is at peace.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FASCINATION OF WHAT'S DIFFICULT\n\n\nThe fascination of what's difficult\nHas dried the sap out of my veins, and rent\nSpontaneous joy and natural content\nOut of my heart. There's something ails our colt\nThat must, as if it had not holy blood,\nNor on an Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,\nShiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt\nAs though it dragged road metal. My curse on plays\nThat have to be set up in fifty ways,\nOn the day's war with every knave and dolt,\nTheatre business, management of men.\nI swear before the dawn comes round again\nI'll find the stable and pull out the bolt.\n\n\n\n\nA DRINKING SONG\n\n\nWine comes in at the mouth\nAnd love comes in at the eye;\nThat's all we shall know for truth\nBefore we grow old and die.\nI lift the glass to my mouth,\nI look at you, and I sigh.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COMING OF WISDOM WITH TIME\n\n\nThough leaves are many, the root is one;\nThrough all the lying days of my youth\nI swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;\nNow I may wither into the truth.\n\n\n\n\nON HEARING THAT THE STUDENTS OF OUR NEW UNIVERSITY HAVE JOINED THE\nANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS AND THE AGITATION AGAINST IMMORAL LITERATURE\n\n\nWhere, where but here have Pride and Truth,\nThat long to give themselves for wage,\nTo shake their wicked sides at youth\nRestraining reckless middle-age.\n\n\n\n\nTO A POET, WHO WOULD HAVE ME PRAISE CERTAIN BAD POETS, IMITATORS OF HIS\nAND MINE\n\n\nYou say, as I have often given tongue\nIn praise of what another's said or sung,\n'Twere politic to do the like by these;\nBut have you known a dog to praise his fleas?\n\n\n\n\nTHE MASK\n\n\n'Put off that mask of burning gold\nWith emerald eyes.'\n'O no, my dear, you make so bold\nTo find if hearts be wild and wise,\nAnd yet not cold.'\n\n'I would but find what's there to find,\nLove or deceit.'\n'It was the mask engaged your mind,\nAnd after set your heart to beat,\nNot what's behind.'\n\n'But lest you are my enemy,\nI must enquire.'\n'O no, my dear, let all that be,\nWhat matter, so there is but fire\nIn you, in me?'\n\n\n\n\nUPON A HOUSE SHAKEN BY THE LAND AGITATION\n\n\nHow should the world be luckier if this house,\nWhere passion and precision have been one\nTime out of mind, became too ruinous\nTo breed the lidless eye that loves the sun?\nAnd the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow\nWhere wings have memory of wings, and all\nThat comes of the best knit to the best? Although\nMean roof-trees were the sturdier for its fall,\nHow should their luck run high enough to reach\nThe gifts that govern men, and after these\nTo gradual Time's last gift, a written speech\nWrought of high laughter, loveliness and ease?\n\n\n\n\nAT THE ABBEY THEATRE\n\n(Imitated from Ronsard)\n\n\nDear Craoibhin Aoibhin, look into our case.\nWhen we are high and airy hundreds say\nThat if we hold that flight they'll leave the place,\nWhile those same hundreds mock another day\nBecause we have made our art of common things,\nSo bitterly, you'd dream they longed to look\nAll their lives through into some drift of wings.\nYou've dandled them and fed them from the book\nAnd know them to the bone; impart to us--\nWe'll keep the secret--a new trick to please.\nIs there a bridle for this Proteus\nThat turns and changes like his draughty seas?\nOr is there none, most popular of men,\nBut when they mock us that we mock again?\n\n\n\n\nTHESE ARE THE CLOUDS\n\n\nThese are the clouds about the fallen sun,\nThe majesty that shuts his burning eye;\nThe weak lay hand on what the strong has done,\nTill that be tumbled that was lifted high\nAnd discord follow upon unison,\nAnd all things at one common level lie.\nAnd therefore, friend, if your great race were run\nAnd these things came, so much the more thereby\nHave you made greatness your companion,\nAlthough it be for children that you sigh:\nThese are the clouds about the fallen sun,\nThe majesty that shuts his burning eye.\n\n\n\n\nAT GALWAY RACES\n\n\nThere where the course is,\nDelight makes all of the one mind,\nThe riders upon the galloping horses,\nThe crowd that closes in behind:\nWe, too, had good attendance once,\nHearers and hearteners of the work;\nAye, horsemen for companions,\nBefore the merchant and the clerk\nBreathed on the world with timid breath.\nSing on: sometime, and at some new moon,\nWe'll learn that sleeping is not death,\nHearing the whole earth change its tune,\nIts flesh being wild, and it again\nCrying aloud as the race course is,\nAnd we find hearteners among men\nThat ride upon horses.\n\n\n\n\nA FRIEND'S ILLNESS\n\n\nSickness brought me this\nThought, in that scale of his:\nWhy should I be dismayed\nThough flame had burned the whole\nWorld, as it were a coal,\nNow I have seen it weighed\nAgainst a soul?\n\n\n\n\nALL THINGS CAN TEMPT ME\n\n\nAll things can tempt me from this craft of verse:\nOne time it was a woman's face, or worse--\nThe seeming needs of my fool-driven land;\nNow nothing but comes readier to the hand\nThan this accustomed toil.

I will go out myself.\nMy pupils said that they would find a man\nWhose faith I never shook--they may have found him.\nTherefore I will go out--but if I go,\nThe glass will let the sands run out unseen.\nI cannot go--I cannot leave the glass.\nGo call my pupils--I can explain all now,\nOnly when all our hold on life is troubled,\nOnly in spiritual terror can the Truth\nCome through the broken mind--as the pease burst\nOut of a broken pease-cod.\n\n                              [He clutches Bridget as she is going.\n\n                          Say to them,\nThat Nature would lack all in her most need,\nCould not the soul find truth as in a flash,\nUpon the battle-field, or in the midst\nOf overwhelming waves, and say to them--\nBut no, they would but answer as I bid.\n\nBRIDGET\n\nYou want somebody to get up an argument with.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nLook out and see if there is any one\nThere in the street--I cannot leave the glass,\nFor somebody might shake it, and the sand\nIf it were shaken might run down on the instant.\n\nBRIDGET\n\nI don't understand a word you are saying. There's a crowd of people\ntalking to your pupils.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nGo out and find if they have found a man\nWho did not understand me when I taught,\nOr did not listen.\n\nBRIDGET\n\nIt is a hard thing to be married to a man of learning that must always\nbe having arguments.\n\n                                                     [She goes out.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nStrange that I should be blind to the great secret,\nAnd that so simple a man might write it out\nUpon a blade of grass or bit of rush\nWith naught but berry juice, and laugh to himself\nWriting it out, because it was so simple.\n\n                               [Enter Bridget followed by the Fool.\n\nFOOL\n\nGive me something; give me a penny to buy bacon in the shops and nuts in\nthe market, and strong drink for the time when the sun is weak.\n\nBRIDGET\n\nI have no pennies. (To Wise Man) Your pupils cannot find anybody to\nargue with you. There's nobody in the whole country with belief enough\nfor a lover's oath. Can't you be quiet now, and not always wanting to\nhave arguments? It must be terrible to have a mind like that.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nThen I am lost indeed.\n\nBRIDGET\n\nLeave me alone now, I have to make the bread for you and the children.\n\n                                            [She goes into kitchen.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nChildren, children!\n\n\nBRIDGET\n\nYour father wants you, run to him.\n\n                                                  [Children run in.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nCome to me, children. Do not be afraid.\nI want to know if you believe in Heaven,\nGod or the soul--no, do not tell me yet;\nYou need not be afraid I shall be angry,\nSay what you please--so that it is your thought--\nI wanted you to know before you spoke,\nThat I shall not be angry.\n\nFIRST CHILD\n\nWe have not forgotten, Father.\n\nSECOND CHILD\n\nOh no, Father.\n\nBOTH CHILDREN\n\n(As if repeating a lesson) There is nothing we cannot see, nothing we\ncannot touch.\n\nFIRST CHILD\n\nFoolish people used to say that there was, but you have taught us better.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nGo to your mother, go--yet do not go.\nWhat can she say? If I am dumb you are lost;\nAnd yet, because the sands are running out,\nI have but a moment to show it all in. Children,\nThe sap would die out of the blades of grass\nHad they a doubt. They understand it all,\nBeing the fingers of God's certainty,\nYet can but make their sign into the air;\nBut could they find their tongues they'd show it all;\nBut what am I to say that am but one,\nWhen they are millions and they will not speak--\n\n                                            [Children have run out.\n\nBut they are gone; what made them run away?\n\n                               [The Fool comes in with a dandelion.\n\nLook at me, tell me if my face is changed,\nIs there a notch of the fiend's nail upon it\nAlready? Is it terrible to sight?\nBecause the moment's near.\n\n                                                   [Going to glass.\n\n                          I dare not look,\nI dare not know the moment when they come.\nNo, no, I dare not. (Covers glass.)\nWill there be a footfall,\nOr will there be a sort of rending sound,\nOr else a cracking, as though an iron claw\nHad gripped the threshold stone?\n\n                             [Fool has begun to blow the dandelion.\n\n                  What are you doing?\n\nFOOL\n\nWait a minute--four--five--six--\n\nWISE MAN\n\nWhat are you doing that for?\n\nFOOL\n\nI am blowing the dandelion to find out what hour it is.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nYou have heard everything, and that is why\nYou'd find what hour it is--you'd find that out,\nThat you may look upon a fleet of devils\nDragging my soul away. You shall not stop,\nI will have no one here when they come in,\nI will have no one sitting there--no one--\nAnd yet--and yet--there is something strange about you.\nI half remember something. What is it?\nDo you believe in God and in the soul?\n\nFOOL\n\nSo you ask me now. I thought when you were asking your pupils, 'Will he\nask Teigue the Fool? Yes, he will, he will; no, he will not--yes, he\nwill.' But Teigue will say nothing. Teigue will say nothing.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nTell me quickly.\n\nFOOL\n\nI said, 'Teigue knows everything, not even the green-eyed cats and the\nhares that milk the cows have Teigue's wisdom'; but Teigue will not speak,\nhe says nothing.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nSpeak, speak, for underneath the cover there\nThe sand is running from the upper glass,\nAnd when the last grain's through, I shall be lost.\n\nFOOL\n\nI will not speak. I will not tell you what is in my mind. I will not\ntell you what is in my bag. You might steal away my thoughts. I met a\nbodach on the road yesterday, and he said, 'Teigue, tell me how many\npennies are in your bag; I will wager three pennies that there are\nnot twenty pennies in your bag; let me put in my hand and count them.'\nBut I gripped the bag the tighter, and when I go to sleep at night I\nhide the bag where nobody knows.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nThere's but one pinch of sand, and I am lost\nIf you are not he I seek.\n\nFOOL\n\nO, what a lot the Fool knows, but he says nothing.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nYes, I remember now. You spoke of angels.\nYou said but now that you had seen an angel.\nYou are the one I seek, and I am saved.\n\nFOOL\n\nOh no. How could poor Teigue see angels? Oh, Teigue tells one tale here,\nanother there, and everybody gives him pennies. If Teigue had not his\ntales he would starve.\n\n                                      [He breaks away and goes out.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nThe last hope is gone,\nAnd now that it's too late I see it all,\nWe perish into God and sink away\nInto reality--the rest's a dream.\n\n                                              [The Fool comes back.\n\nFOOL\n\nThere was one there--there by the threshold stone, waiting there; and he\nsaid, 'Go in, Teigue, and tell him everything that he asks you. He will\ngive you a penny if you tell him.'\n\nWISE MAN\n\nI know enough, that know God's will prevails.\n\nFOOL\n\nWaiting till the moment had come--That is what the one out there was\nsaying, but I might tell you what you asked. That is what he was saying.\n\nWISE MAN\n\nBe silent. May God's will prevail on the instant,\nAlthough His will be my eternal pain.\nI have no question:\nIt is enough, I know what fixed the station\nOf star and cloud.\nAnd knowing all, I cry\nThat what so God has willed\nOn the instant be fulfilled,\nThough that be my damnation.\nThe stream of the world has changed its course,\nAnd with the stream my thoughts have run\nInto some cloudy thunderous spring\nThat is its mountain source--\nAye, to some frenzy of the mind,\nFor all that we have done's undone,\nOur speculation but as the wind.\n\n                                                          [He dies.\n\nFOOL\n\nWise man--Wise man, wake up and I will tell you everything for a penny.\nIt is I, poor Teigue the Fool. Why don't you wake up, and say, 'There\nis a penny for you, Teigue'? No, no, you will say nothing. You and I,\nwe are the two fools, we know everything, but we will not speak.\n\n                                    [Angel enters holding a casket.\n\nO, look what has come from his mouth! O, look what has come from his\nmouth--the white butterfly! He is dead, and I have taken his soul in my\nhands; but I know why you open the lid of that golden box. I must give\nit to you. There then, (he puts butterfly in casket) he has gone\nthrough his pains, and you will open the lid in the Garden of Paradise.\n(He closes curtain and remains outside it.) He is gone, he is gone,\nhe is gone, but come in, everybody in the world, and look at me.\n\n'I hear the wind a blow\nI hear the grass a grow,\nAnd all that I know, I know.'\nBut I will not speak, I will run away.\n\n                                                      [He goes out."
