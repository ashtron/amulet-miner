const eliot = "Gerontion\n\nThou hast nor youth nor age\nBut as it were an after dinner sleep\nDreaming of both.\n\n\nHere I am, an old man in a dry month,\nBeing read to by a boy, waiting for rain.\nI was neither at the hot gates\nNor fought in the warm rain\nNor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,\nBitten by flies, fought.\nMy house is a decayed house,\nAnd the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,\nSpawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,\nBlistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.\nThe goat coughs at night in the field overhead;\nRocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.\nThe woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,\nSneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.\n\nI an old man,\nA dull head among windy spaces.\n\nSigns are taken for wonders. We would see a sign:\nThe word within a word, unable to speak a word,\nSwaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year\nCame Christ the tiger\n\nIn depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,\nTo be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk\nAmong whispers; by Mr. Silvero\nWith caressing hands, at Limoges\nWho walked all night in the next room;\nBy Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;\nBy Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room\nShifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp\nWho turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles\nWeave the wind. I have no ghosts,\nAn old man in a draughty house\nUnder a windy knob.\n\nAfter such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now\nHistory has many cunning passages, contrived corridors\nAnd issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,\nGuides us by vanities. Think now\nShe gives when our attention is distracted\nAnd what she gives, gives with such supple confusions\nThat the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late\nWhat's not believed in, or if still believed,\nIn memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon\nInto weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with\nTill the refusal propagates a fear. Think\nNeither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices\nAre fathered by our heroism. Virtues\nAre forced upon us by our impudent crimes.\nThese tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.\n\nThe tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last\nWe have not reached conclusion, when I\nStiffen in a rented house. Think at last\nI have not made this show purposelessly\nAnd it is not by any concitation\nOf the backward devils.\nI would meet you upon this honestly.\nI that was near your heart was removed therefrom\nTo lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.\nI have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it\nSince what is kept must be adulterated?\nI have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:\nHow should I use it for your closer contact?\n\nThese with a thousand small deliberations\nProtract the profit of their chilled delirium,\nExcite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,\nWith pungent sauces, multiply variety\nIn a wilderness of mirrors.

On the Rialto once.\nThe rats are underneath the piles.\nThe jew is underneath the lot.\nMoney in furs.

I myself can hardly understand.\nWe must leave it now to fate.\nYou will write, at any rate.\nPerhaps it is not too late.\nI shall sit here, serving tea to friends.\n\nAnd I must borrow every changing shape\nTo find expression... dance, dance\nLike a dancing bear,\nCry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.\nLet us take the air, in a tobacco trance--\nWell! and what if she should die some afternoon,\nAfternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;\nShould die and leave me sitting pen in hand\nWith the smoke coming down above the housetops;\nDoubtful, for quite a while\nNot knowing what to feel or if I understand\nOr whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon...\nWould she not have the advantage, after all?\nThis music is successful with a dying fall\nNow that we talk of dying--\nAnd should I have the right to smile?\n\n\n\n\nPreludes\n\nI\n\nThe winter evening settles down\nWith smell of steaks in passageways.\nSix o'clock.\nThe burnt-out ends of smoky days.\nAnd now a gusty shower wraps\nThe grimy scraps\nOf withered leaves about your feet\nAnd newspapers from vacant lots;\nThe showers beat\nOn broken blinds and chimney-pots,\nAnd at the corner of the street\nA lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.\nAnd then the lighting of the lamps.\n\nII\n\nThe morning comes to consciousness\nOf faint stale smells of beer\nFrom the sawdust-trampled street\nWith all its muddy feet that press\nTo early coffee-stands.\n\nWith the other masquerades\nThat time resumes,\nOne thinks of all the hands\nThat are raising dingy shades\nIn a thousand furnished rooms.\n\nIII\n\nYou tossed a blanket from the bed,\nYou lay upon your back, and waited;\nYou dozed, and watched the night revealing\nThe thousand sordid images\nOf which your soul was constituted;\nThey flickered against the ceiling.\nAnd when all the world came back\nAnd the light crept up between the shutters,\nAnd you heard the sparrows in the gutters,\nYou had such a vision of the street\nAs the street hardly understands;\nSitting along the bed's edge, where\nYou curled the papers from your hair,\nOr clasped the yellow soles of feet\nIn the palms of both soiled hands.\n\nIV\n\nHis soul stretched tight across the skies\nThat fade behind a city block,\nOr trampled by insistent feet\nAt four and five and six o'clock;\nAnd short square fingers stuffing pipes,\nAnd evening newspapers, and eyes\nAssured of certain certainties,\nThe conscience of a blackened street\nImpatient to assume the world.\n\nI am moved by fancies that are curled\nAround these images, and cling:\nThe notion of some infinitely gentle\nInfinitely suffering thing.\n\nWipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;\nThe worlds revolve like ancient women\nGathering fuel in vacant lots.\n\n\n\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night\n\nTwelve o'clock.\nAlong the reaches of the street\nHeld in a lunar synthesis,\nWhispering lunar incantations\nDisolve the floors of memory\nAnd all its clear relations,\nIts divisions and precisions,\nEvery street lamp that I pass\nBeats like a fatalistic drum,\nAnd through the spaces of the dark\nMidnight shakes the memory\nAs a madman shakes a dead geranium.\n\nHalf-past one,\nThe street lamp sputtered,\nThe street lamp muttered,\nThe street lamp said,\nRegard that woman\nWho hesitates toward you in the light of the door\nWhich opens on her like a grin.\nYou see the border of her dress\nIs torn and stained with sand,\nAnd you see the corner of her eye\nTwists like a crooked pin.\n\nThe memory throws up high and dry\nA crowd of twisted things;\nA twisted branch upon the beach\nEaten smooth, and polished\nAs if the world gave up\nThe secret of its skeleton,\nStiff and white.\nA broken spring in a factory yard,\nRust that clings to the form that the strength has left\nHard and curled and ready to snap.\n\nHalf-past two,\nThe street-lamp said,\nRemark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,\nSlips out its tongue\nAnd devours a morsel of rancid butter.\nSo the hand of the child, automatic,\nSlipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along\nthe quay.\nI could see nothing behind that child's eye.\nI have seen eyes in the street\nTrying to peer through lighted shutters,\nAnd a crab one afternoon in a pool,\nAn old crab with barnacles on his back,\nGripped the end of a stick which I held him.\n\nHalf-past three,\nThe lamp sputtered,\nThe lamp muttered in the dark.\n\nThe lamp hummed:\nRegard the moon,\nLa lune ne garde aucune rancune,\nShe winks a feeble eye,\nShe smiles into corners.\nShe smooths the hair of the grass.\nThe moon has lost her memory.\nA washed-out smallpox cracks her face,\nHer hand twists a paper rose,\nThat smells of dust and old Cologne,\nShe is alone With all the old nocturnal smells\nThat cross and cross across her brain.\nThe reminiscence comes\nOf sunless dry geraniums\nAnd dust in crevices,\nSmells of chestnuts in the streets\nAnd female smells in shuttered rooms\nAnd cigarettes in corridors\nAnd cocktail smells in bars.\n\nThe lamp said,\nFour o'clock,\nHere is the number on the door.\nMemory!\nYou have the key,\nThe little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,\nMount.\nThe bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,\nPut your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.\n\nThe last twist of the knife.\n\n\n\n\nMorning at the Window\n\nThey are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,\nAnd along the trampled edges of the street\nI am aware of the damp souls of housemaids\nSprouting despondently at area gates.\nThe brown waves of fog toss up to me\nTwisted faces from the bottom of the street,\nAnd tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts\nAn aimless smile that hovers in the air\nAnd vanishes along the level of the roofs.\n\n\n\n\nThe Boston Evening Transcript\n\nThe readers of the Boston Evening Transcript\nSway in the wind like a field of ripe corn.\nWhen evening quickens faintly in the street,\nWakening the appetites of life in some\nAnd to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript,\nI mount the steps and ring the bell, turning\nWearily, as one would turn to nod good-bye to Rochefoucauld,\nIf the street were time and he at the end of the street,\nAnd I say, Cousin Harriet, here is the Boston Evening Transcript.\n\n\n\n\nAunt Helen\n\nMiss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,\nAnd lived in a small house near a fashionable square\nCared for by servants to the number of four.\nNow when she died there was silence in heaven\nAnd silence at her end of the street.\nThe shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet--\nHe was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.\nThe dogs were handsomely provided for,\nBut shortly afterwards the parrot died too.\nThe Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,\nAnd the footman sat upon the dining-table\nHolding the second housemaid on his knees--\nWho had always been so careful while her mistress lived.\n\n\n\n\nCousin Nancy\n\nMiss Nancy Ellicott Strode across the hills and broke them,\nRode across the hills and broke them--\nThe barren New England hills--\nRiding to hounds\nOver the cow-pasture.\n\nMiss Nancy Ellicott smoked\nAnd danced all the modern dances;\nAnd her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it,\nBut they knew that it was modern.\n\nUpon the glazen shelves kept watch\nMatthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,\nThe army of unalterable law.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Apollinax\n\nWhen Mr. Apollinax visited the United States\nHis laughter tinkled among the teacups.\nI thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,\nAnd of Priapus in the shrubbery\nGaping at the lady in the swing.\nIn the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah's\nHe laughed like an irresponsible foetus.\nHWith your aid indiffeis laughter was submarine and profound\nLike the old man of the sea's\nHidden under coral islands\nWhere worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,\nDropping from fingers of surf.\nI looked for the head of Mr. Apollinax rolling under a chair\nOr grinning over a screen\nWith seaweed in its hair.\nI heard the beat of centaur's hoofs over the hard turf\nAs his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.\nHe is a charming man--But after all what did he mean?--\nHis pointed ears... He must be unbalanced,--\nThere was something he said that I might have challenged.\nOf dowager Mrs. Phlaccus, and Professor and Mrs. Cheetah\nI remember a slice of lemon, and a bitten macaroon.\n\n\n\n\nHysteria\n\nAs she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her\nlaughter and being part of it, until her teeth were\nonly accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill. I\nwas drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary\nrecovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her\nthroat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An\nelderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly\nspreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty\ngreen iron table, saying: If the lady and gentleman\nwish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and\ngentleman wish to take their tea in the garden... I\ndecided that if the shaking of her breasts could be\nstopped, some of the fragments of the afternoon might\nbe collected, and I concentrated my attention with\ncareful subtlety to this end.\n\n\n\n\nConversation Galante\n\nI observe: Our sentimental friend the moon!\nOr possibly (fantastic, I confess)\nIt may be Prester John's balloon\nOr an old battered lantern hung aloft\nTo light poor travellers to their distress.\nShe then: How you digress!\n\nAnd I then: Some one frames upon the keys\nThat exquisite nocturne, with which we explain\nThe night and moonshine; music which we seize\nTo body forth our vacuity.\nShe then: Does this refer to me?\nOh no, it is I who am inane.\n\nYou, madam, are the eternal humorist,\nThe eternal enemy of the absolute,\nGiving our vagrant moods the slightest twist!\nWith your air indifferent and imperious\nAt a stroke our mad poetics to confute--\nAnd--Are we then so serious?\n\n\n\n\nLa Figlia Che Piange\n\nO quam te memorem Virgo...\n\n\nStand on the highest pavement of the stair--\nLean on a garden urn--\nWeave, weave the sunlight in your hair--\nClasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise--\nFling them to the ground and turn\nWith a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\nBut weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\n\nSo I would have had him leave,\nSo I would have had her stand and grieve,\nSo he would have left\nAs the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\nAs the mind deserts the body it has used.\nI should find\nSome way incomparably light and deft,\nSome way we both should understand,\nSimple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.\n\nShe turned away, but with the autumn weather\nCompelled my imagination many days,\nMany days and many hours:\nHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\nAnd I wonder how they should have been together!\nI should have lost a gesture and a pose.\nSometimes these cogitations still amaze\nThe troubled midnight and the noon's repose."
